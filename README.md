# cAssert - Code longer, debug faster.
###aka. colouredAssert is an extended, coloured assertion header for C.

Avoid late night fuzzy vision with colour highlighted assertions, complete with dev time messages to reduce debug times.
As an added bonus, cAssert includes colour highlighted info messages that are treated like assertions in terms of 'NDEBUG'.
