## cAssert
#aka. colouredAssert is an extended, coloured assertion header for C.
#Code longer, debug faster.

Avoid late night fuzzy vision with colour highlighted assertions, complete with dev time messages to reduce debug times.
As an added bonus, cAssert includes info message that are treated like assertions in terms of NDEBUG.
